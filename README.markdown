MultiCreate
---
_This is a way to seamlessly create multiple build areas in a minecraft server._  
It uses an algorithm to split the world into a "build" and a "survival" area.
By default it makes x>=0 creative and everything else survival.

Setup
---
1. Download the [bleeding edge jar here](https://github.com/outerearthinteractive/MultiCreate/raw/master/MultiCreate.jar). This is the development branch and auto built. There will be a more stable version later.
2. Put the jar into the bukkit plugins folder.
3. Run the server.

Config
---
There are currently no config options. This is an issue that will be fixed.
