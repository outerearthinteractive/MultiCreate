MultiCreate
---
_This is a way to seamlessly create multiple build areas._  
It uses an algorithm to split the world into a "build" and a "survival" area.
By default it makes x>=0 creative and everything else survival.

Setup
---
Download the [bleeding edge jar here](https://github.com/outerearthinteractive/MultiCreate/raw/master/MultiCreate.jar). This is the development branch and auto built. There will be a more stable version later.
